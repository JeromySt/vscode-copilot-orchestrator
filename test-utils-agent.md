## Copilot Orchestrator Extension

The Copilot Orchestrator is a Visual Studio Code extension that turns GitHub Copilot into a parallel development powerhouse. It allows you to decompose complex work into a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of tasks and execute them simultaneously — each in its own isolated git worktree with automated pre-checks, AI-driven work, post-checks, and merge-back.
