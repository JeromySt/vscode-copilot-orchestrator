# Code Review Practices

Effective code reviews focus on maintainability, logic correctness, and adherence to project standards. Reviewers should provide constructive feedback that improves code quality while being respectful and clear. Automate style checks where possible and reserve human review for complex logic, architectural decisions, and potential bugs.
