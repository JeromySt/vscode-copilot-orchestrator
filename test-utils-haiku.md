# Code Review Practices

Effective code reviews focus on logic, maintainability, and potential bugs rather than style preferences.
Reviewers should ask clarifying questions, acknowledge good practices, and suggest improvements constructively.
Tests validate correctness; reviews catch design issues, edge cases, and knowledge sharing opportunities.
