# Software Testing Best Practices

Effective software testing relies on writing clear, isolated, and repeatable tests that cover both expected behavior and edge cases. Prioritize unit tests for fast feedback, supplement with integration tests for cross-component verification, and use end-to-end tests sparingly for critical user flows. Automate your test suite in CI to catch regressions early, and maintain meaningful assertions that describe intent rather than implementation details.
