# Software Testing Best Practices

Write tests that are isolated, repeatable, and focused on a single behavior. Prioritize meaningful assertions over high coverage numbers, and ensure tests run quickly to maintain a fast feedback loop. Use descriptive test names that document the expected behavior, making failures easy to diagnose. Automate your test suite in CI to catch regressions early and keep the codebase stable.
